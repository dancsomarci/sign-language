-train static model (start with simple cnn, and build your way up to attention mechanism perhaps)
-data augmentation
-create suplemental algorithms and test with camera
-llm correction for dynamic/double signs, maybe motion tracking

-create newest pipeline to teach fs-seq
-build recurrent networks
-create testing pipeline for sequential models

-sign classification why works sometimes? (lower batchnorm and dropout for faster learning perhaps?, less training data)

?theoretical problems:
	-extend without retraining (train to produce exact latent vector and when)
	-combine branches
