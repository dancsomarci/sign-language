-sign language basics (fs, signing)
-why asl

-Glove, traditional image processing

-pose estimation, advantages
-compare 2 methods and declare mediapipe winner or just use mediapipe because of dataset

Goals:
	-real-times needs, latency and complexity restrains (5G signaling for help in car crash calculation.)
	-is pose estimation good enough for the task?

Mention:
	-tech stack: parquet, tfdataset/records

(Don't forget data description, statistics, preprocessing, metrics, compare learning curves, go through parameters in notebooks etc...)

-asl fs challenges (j, z etc..., fun facts etc...)
-fingerspelling static
	-other datasets can't be used with mediapipe
	-collected my own #TODO collect more
	-compare models, augment data #TODO
	-extend with simple things like kálmán filter
	-??llm correction for dynamic/double signs
	-??track motion if certain fingers and build a model for dynamic signs
-signing detection model
	-prove that is more than simple heuristic
-fingerspelling from seq
	-translation task, encoder, decoder approach
	-RNN #TODO (+can be stacked as well)
	-GRU
	-LSTM
	-Transformer (Math from tf notebook and original paper)
	-Transformer with positional encoding
		- for landmarks processing try both with and without (mention semantically incorrect)
	-Transformer with ECA for LandmarkEmbedding
		- with and without skip connections
	-extening models with 5-6 other techniques (look for explanation and flow in the notebooks) #TODO detection and pred in same model, and also rollout from buffer
-signs classification from seq (explain why)
	-models #TODO
	-extending model with clever algorithms
	??can we extend without retraining #TODO

??combine two branches
	-classification between the two forms
	-propose a huge transformer that can handle a ton of tokens like google translate. (dataset needed)

-Results and conclusion (This is the most important part!)
	-models
	-methods (whats the future, what data has to be collected)
	-is pose approximation in its current form enough?
		-when do problems arise (youtube video)
		-maybe hybrid between glove based using a ring on the thumb
		-I believe in this method
