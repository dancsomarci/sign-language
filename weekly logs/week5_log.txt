Fingerspelling:
---------------
-New Lstm model to compare with
-Experiments with new ideas from Hoyeul Sohn
-different ways to enhance model in application

-static mode:
	-collected dataset of myself
	-J, Z rely on movement I have indea to classify between them (hybrid model)


Sign classification:
--------------------
-Finally found new model (still figuring out why it works)
	-New preprocessing
	-skip connections seem to be the key
	-Masking away the padding in Conv1D
	-best so far 74% (~80% was the best in the competition)


Questions:
----------
-Do I need an integrated solution or just the research of the 2 branches?
-Should I write about neurons and stuff and the math behind them or stay more high level?
-No static mode for sign detection is that good enough?

-Dipterv portal subject? what is that?
-Other deadlines?

Plan:
-----
-Coding and models ready this week
-2 weeks to write the thesis
